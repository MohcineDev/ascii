<p align="center"> Few lines describing your project.
    <br> 
    You must follow the same instructions as in the first subject but this time with colors.

The output should manipulate colors using the flag --color=<color> <letters to be colored>, in which --color is the flag and <color> is the color desired by the user and <letters to be colored> is the letter or letters that you can chose to be colored. These colors can be achieved using different notations (color code systems, like RGB, hsl, ANSI...), it is up to you to choose which one you want to use.
